## üèÅ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **macOS 26.0 or later**
- **Xcode 15 or later**

### Building Smith

1. Open `Smith.xcodeproj` in **Xcode 15** or later.
2. In the **Signing & Capabilities** tab for the **Smith** target, enable the **Apple Intelligence** capability. This adds the required `com.apple.developer.apple-intelligence` entitlements found in `Smith/Smith.entitlements`.
3. Select the **Smith** scheme and click **Run** (or press <kbd>‚åòR</kbd>) to build and launch the app.

### Build & Run

1. Open `Smith.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
2. Select the **Smith** target from the scheme menu.
3. Click **Run** to build and launch the app.

### LaunchAgent & CLI Options

Smith can run in the background using a LaunchAgent. From the app's **Background Settings** you can install the agent which places
`~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.motherofbrand.Smith.BackgroundMonitor.plist` on your Mac. The agent launches Smith with the following
command‚Äëline options:

- `--background-monitor` &ndash; run the app headlessly for background monitoring
- `--intensity=<minimal|medium|balanced|comprehensive>` &ndash; control monitoring frequency

You can manually load or unload the agent at any time:

```bash
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.motherofbrand.Smith.BackgroundMonitor.plist
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.motherofbrand.Smith.BackgroundMonitor.plist
```
